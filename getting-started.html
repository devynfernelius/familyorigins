            <h2>Yes! Learning how to do basic research won't cost you a dime. However, if you want to take a DNA test you will have to pay roughly $80 depending on which company you buy it from.</h2>

          How do you get started?  
        </p>
        <p>
            Honestly, the best place to start is to write down everything you do know. Start with your parents, your grandparents, and even your aunts and uncles. Then write down the information you know about them from their names, birth dates, places of birth, spouses, marriage dates, maiden names, children, and death dates. Please don't be overwhelmed by this! **It's OK if you don't know all of this information** Whatever pieces are missing you start by asking family members who do know this information. Then take the information you know or have gathered and put it into a database such as FamilySearch or Ancestry. **More information to come**
