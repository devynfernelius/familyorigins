          What does Family Origins offer?  
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowledge! Explore my site to learn more about your ancestors! I will educate you on doing basic genealogy work. I will also help parents who like family history, but need ideas on how to help your children be interested in family history. I will do that by giving parents activity ideas that are fun for the whole family! I also want to help people who are adopted learn more about either your birth family or your birth family's culture (depending on what your situation is).

                What makes Family Origins different from other websites?
            </p>
            <p>
                I have experience doing family history and can give tips based on my own experience doing family history and can give tips based on my own experience. I may not be a parent, but I can be the voice of other parents who can give advice for your family. I can help adoptees because I am adopted and know how you can learm more about your birth family (no matter what your circumstances are).
