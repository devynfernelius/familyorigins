      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p> My purpose is to make a website that shows easy ways to start learning about your family history. This is important because it helps people gain an appreciation of their ancestors, it helps them understand the present better, and studies have shown that learning about it improves your mental health. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p> My audience is for anybody (young or old) who wants advice on how to begin learning about their family history. </p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Why will people come to your site?
        People will come to my site because they want to learn more about their ancestors, but they're not sure how to get started. These visitors will mainly come to educate themselves on doing basic genealogy work. Parents will also want to come because they like family history, but they need ideas on how to help their children be interested in family history. These visitors will mainly come to make family history fun for the whole family (especially children and teenagers). I also want to help people who are adopted learn more about either their family or their ancestor's culture. These visitors will mainly come for help on learn and find their birth family (or their culture if they keep running into dead ends).
        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
        They will come to my site because I have a little bit of experience in doing my own family history and can tell them ideas that work best based on my own experience. Another reason they'll come to my website is because I'm adopted, and I have an idea on how to help other people who are adopted learn more about their family history. I can even help people who keep running into dead ends but still want to feel a connection to their birth family. I may not have kids yet, but I know plenty of families who have kids of all ages who can give me advice that I can relate to my visitors.

      </ul>
      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>
        The questions my site will answer are “How do I get started?” and “Can I do family history for free?”. For people wanting to get started, I will have advice on how to get started and I will also provide video links to RootsTech videos for more clarification. So, their activities will mainly be educational. For getting started, I'll need information on how to help beginners start their family history research.

      </ul>
      <h3>For Parents</h3>
      <p>
        Then the questions my site will answer are “What activities can I do to keep my little children (below age 10) engaged but learning about their ancestors?” and “How can I help my teenage children become interested in learning about their ancestors?”. For parents, I will have a list of fun activities to do with their children and teenagers along with providing links to RootsTech for more activity ideas. For lack of better words, their activities will mainly be recreational (while still being educational). To keep things interesting for them, I will have a new activity of the week for families to try. For parents, I'll need to find activities that other parents have used for their children and teenagers that have helped them be engaged.

      </ul>

      <ul>
        <h3>For Adoptees</h3>
        <p>
          Lastly, the questions my site will answer are “How can I learn more about my birth family?” and “What if I can't find anything about my birth family or they don't want anything to do with me?”. For people who are adopted, there will be a list of things to ask your parents (or older siblings if applicable), a list of places to help them find records in their area, and (if they're willing to spend the money) a list of DNA tests. While their activities are also educational, their activities will also be a form of self-discovery. For people who are adopted, I'll need information that will help advise them on where to start looking for their birth parents if the information their adopted parents (or older siblings) have is limited. I would also want more information on the main DNA tests and what each of them do. (Since some of them focus on ethnicity while others focus on genetic health.)
